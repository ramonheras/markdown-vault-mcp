# Git Integration

Use this guide to choose and configure the right git mode for your deployment.

## Modes

1. **Managed** (`GIT_REPO_URL` + `GIT_TOKEN`)
   The server owns clone, periodic pull, commit, and deferred push.
2. **Unmanaged / commit-only** (no `GIT_REPO_URL`, existing git repo)
   The server stages and commits writes, but never pulls or pushes.
3. **No-git** (default)
   The vault is treated as a plain directory with no git operations.

## Managed Mode (Recommended For Containerized Deployments)

Use managed mode when the server should fully own git synchronization.

```bash
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_SOURCE_DIR=/data/vault
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_READ_ONLY=false
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-vault.git
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_USERNAME=x-access-token
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_TOKEN=github_pat_xxx
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_PULL_INTERVAL_S=600
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_PUSH_DELAY_S=30
```

Behavior:

- If `SOURCE_DIR` is empty at startup, the server clones `GIT_REPO_URL` into it.
- If `SOURCE_DIR` is already a git repo, the server verifies `origin` matches `GIT_REPO_URL`.
- Writes are committed and pushed after the configured idle delay.
- Periodic pull uses fast-forward-only updates.

## Manual sync — `git_sync` tool

The periodic loops are time-based: pull every
`MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_PULL_INTERVAL_S` seconds (default 600), push
`MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_PUSH_DELAY_S` seconds after the last write
(default 30). For workflows where the LLM needs to confirm "your changes
are now on the remote" before telling the user to check another device —
or wants to pull in remote edits *right now* before continuing the
conversation — call `git_sync` directly:

```
git_sync(direction="both")
```

Use `direction="pull"` or `direction="push"` to skip a leg. In
`direction="both"` mode the push leg only runs when the pull leg
succeeded; otherwise `push` stays `null` and the LLM should inspect
`pull.reason` (and `pull.conflict_files`) before retrying.

`dry_run=true` previews what a pull *would* do — useful for "is there
anything new on origin?" without risking an in-conversation conflict.
The push leg has no safe local "would this be accepted" probe, so a
dry-run push always returns `applied=false` with
`reason="dry_run_unsupported"`.

!!! info "Conflict outcome — Syncthing-style sibling resolution"
    When the pull would otherwise need an interactive merge, the server
    follows the [#232](https://github.com/pvliesdonk/markdown-vault-mcp/issues/232)
    Syncthing-style flow:

    - The pull **succeeds** (`pull.applied=true`,
      `pull.reason="conflicts_resolved_with_siblings"`).
    - HEAD advances to the remote tip — the canonical path now reflects
      the remote (remote wins).
    - The local versions that conflicted are preserved as
      `<basename>.conflict-mcp-<timestamp>.md` siblings on the same
      path; their vault-relative paths are listed in
      `pull.conflict_files`.
    - `pull.commits_pulled` is `0` on this path because the rebase
      replays your local commits *on top of* the remote tip — the
      counting model only reports linear-history catch-ups.

    The LLM (or a downstream agent) is expected to read the listed
    sibling(s), reconcile the local content against the remote, and
    `delete` the sibling once merged.

The full enumeration of `pull.reason` and `push.reason` values lives in
the [`git_sync` tool reference](../tools/index.md#git_sync).

`git_sync` is hidden when the deployment isn't in managed git mode (no
`MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_REPO_URL` set) or when
`MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_READ_ONLY=true`.

## Unmanaged / Commit-Only Mode

Use unmanaged mode when another process controls pull/push, but you still want MCP writes committed locally.

```bash
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_SOURCE_DIR=/data/vault
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_READ_ONLY=false
# No GIT_REPO_URL
# No GIT_TOKEN required
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_COMMIT_NAME=markdown-vault-mcp
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_COMMIT_EMAIL=noreply@markdown-vault-mcp
```

Behavior:

- If `SOURCE_DIR` is a git repo, writes are committed locally.
- No periodic pull.
- No push.

## No-Git Mode

Use no-git mode when you only need file persistence.

```bash
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_SOURCE_DIR=/data/vault
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_READ_ONLY=false
# No git env vars required
```

Behavior:

- Files are written to disk.
- No staging, commits, pulls, or pushes.

## Provider Username Reference

`MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_USERNAME` controls the HTTPS username prompt:

- GitHub: `x-access-token`
- GitLab: `oauth2`
- Bitbucket: account username

## Git LFS

If your vault tracks large files (PDFs, images) with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com), the server runs `git lfs pull` on startup to resolve LFS pointers into actual file content. This is enabled by default.

Set `MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_LFS=false` to skip the LFS pull — use this when:

- Your vault does not use Git LFS
- `git-lfs` is not installed in your environment
- You want faster startup and don't need LFS-tracked attachments

```bash
MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_GIT_LFS=false
```

## Legacy Compatibility

`GIT_TOKEN` without `GIT_REPO_URL` still works for backward compatibility and logs a deprecation warning.
