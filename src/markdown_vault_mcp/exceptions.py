- ``"never_built"`` — the index has not been built (cold collection, or
  background build was scheduled but did not complete successfully).
- ``"timeout"`` — caller waited via ``wait_until_queryable()`` and the
  bounded timeout elapsed before the build event was set.
- ``"broken"`` — a SQLite ``OperationalError`` surfaced from a
  bucket-3/4 handler call with an errorname OUTSIDE the busy set
  (e.g., ``SQLITE_CORRUPT``, ``SQLITE_NOTADB``, ``SQLITE_CANTOPEN``,
  ``SQLITE_SCHEMA``, ``SQLITE_IOERR``, ``SQLITE_FULL``, generic
  ``SQLITE_ERROR``). The chained ``__cause__`` carries the original
  exception with full traceback. Operator action: inspect the cause
  and likely rebuild the index or free disk space, depending on the
  underlying errorname.
- ``"busy"`` — a SQLite ``OperationalError`` with errorname in
  ``{SQLITE_BUSY, SQLITE_LOCKED}`` — lock contention from concurrent
  connections. The chained ``__cause__`` carries the original
  exception. A retry after a short backoff may succeed.

class IndexUnavailableError(MarkdownMCPError):

    Attributes:
        reason: One of ``"never_built"``, ``"timeout"``, ``"broken"``,
            ``"busy"`` — disambiguates which of the operational
            situations below fired. See the
            :data:`IndexUnavailableReason` Literal for definitions.

    Covers the following operational situations:

    - **Never built** (``reason="never_built"``). The Collection has
      never had ``build_index()`` complete (cold collection on a fresh
      process).
    - **Build did not complete successfully** (``reason="never_built"``).
      A previous background build raised and was not retried
      (``_index_built`` remained False; the captured error is available
      via :meth:`Collection.get_index_status`'s ``error`` field).
    - **Timeout** (``reason="timeout"``). A caller waited via
      :meth:`Collection.wait_until_queryable` and the bounded timeout
      elapsed before the background build signaled completion.
    - **SQLite operational error — broken** (``reason="broken"``). A
      bucket-3/4 MCP handler call raised ``sqlite3.OperationalError``
      with an errorname outside the busy whitelist (e.g.,
      ``SQLITE_CORRUPT``, ``SQLITE_NOTADB``, ``SQLITE_IOERR``). The
      chained ``__cause__`` carries the original; operators should
      inspect and likely rebuild the index from scratch.
    - **SQLite operational error — busy** (``reason="busy"``). A
      bucket-3/4 MCP handler call raised ``sqlite3.OperationalError``
      with errorname in ``{SQLITE_BUSY, SQLITE_LOCKED}`` — lock
      contention from concurrent connections. A retry after a short
      backoff may succeed.

    A captured background-build error is NOT a separate exception
    class: it is diagnostic state surfaced via
    :meth:`Collection.get_index_status`'s ``error`` field.
