    - **Build did not complete successfully.** A previous background
      build raised and was not retried (``_index_built`` remained

      :meth:`Collection.get_index_status`'s ``error`` field).
    - **Timeout.** A caller waited via
      :meth:`Collection.wait_until_queryable` and the bounded timeout
      elapsed before the background build signaled completion.

    A captured background-build error is NOT a separate exception
    class: it is diagnostic state surfaced via
    :meth:`Collection.get_index_status`'s ``error`` field.
