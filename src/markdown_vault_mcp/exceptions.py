    ``get_connection_path``, ``get_toc``) and bucket-4 coordinators
    (``reindex``, ``build_embeddings``) cannot produce correct results
    against an empty / never-built index. They raise this rather than
    silently return wrong answers.

    Callers must call :meth:`Collection.build_index` before these
    methods. Once a background indexer lands (issue #513), the
    :meth:`Collection.wait_for_index_ready` primitive will block on a
    completion event instead of raising.

    See :exc:`IndexBuildFailedError` for the related case where a
    background build started but then raised.

    surface through :meth:`Collection.wait_for_index_ready` and through

    differs: not-ready means wait or check status; failed means
    inspect logs and decide whether to retry via CLI
    ``markdown-vault-mcp index``.
