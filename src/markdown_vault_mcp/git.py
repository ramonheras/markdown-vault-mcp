            and the local MCP versions were preserved as
            ``.conflict-mcp-*`` siblings (see ``conflict_files``).
            ``False`` for ``dry_run`` calls and for failures that left
            HEAD unchanged.
        fast_forward: ``True`` when the pull was (or would have been) a
            clean fast-forward.  ``False`` when divergent history
            required rebase + sibling writes, or when the operation
            failed.  Inspect ``reason`` and ``conflict_files`` to
            distinguish "applied via conflict resolution" from outright
            failure.
        commits_pulled: Count of commits brought in.  Reliable on the

            On ``"rebased"`` and ``"conflicts_resolved_with_siblings"`` this

            commits *on top of* the upstream rather than fast-forwarding,
            so the linear-history "commits pulled" count is not meaningful.
            Inspect ``from_sha != to_sha`` to detect that HEAD actually
            moved on those paths.  In ``dry_run`` mode this is the count

            * ``"rebased"`` — local and remote histories diverged but
              ``git rebase @{upstream}`` replayed local commits cleanly
              on top of the upstream with no manual intervention.

            * ``"no_remote"`` — the upstream tracking branch could not

class GitWriteStrategy:
    """Stateful git strategy: commit per write, deferred push.

    On each callback invocation:

    1. Stages the changed file (``git add`` or ``git add -u`` for deletes).
    2. Commits with an auto-generated message (``"operation: path"``).
    3. Resets the push timer — push fires after ``push_delay_s`` of idle.

    Push is deferred to a background ``threading.Timer`` that resets on
    each write.  When the timer fires (no writes for ``push_delay_s``),
    all accumulated local commits are pushed in a single ``git push``.

    On startup, any unpushed local commits (from a previous crash) are
    pushed immediately.

    Args:
        token: PAT for HTTPS push via ``GIT_ASKPASS``.  ``None`` uses
            SSH or pre-configured credentials.
        username: Username used with token auth. Defaults to
            ``"x-access-token"`` (GitHub-compatible).
        repo_url: Remote URL expected in managed mode.
        managed: When ``True``, ensure the repo exists under ``repo_path``:
            clone into an empty directory or validate ``origin`` on existing repos.
        enable_pull: Enable fetch + ff-only sync methods.
        enable_push: Enable deferred push behavior.
        push_delay_s: Seconds of idle before pushing.  ``0`` disables
            the timer (push only on :meth:`close`).
        commit_name: Git committer name; defaults to
            :attr:`DEFAULT_COMMIT_NAME`.
        commit_email: Git committer email; defaults to

        git_lfs: When ``True`` (default), run ``git lfs pull`` during
            lazy initialisation so LFS pointers are resolved before the
            first write is committed.  Requires ``git-lfs`` to be on
            ``PATH``; failures are logged at ERROR and never propagated.
        repo_path: Optional repository path used for startup validation.
            When set together with ``token``, startup raises
            :class:`~markdown_vault_mcp.exceptions.ConfigurationError`

        Never force-pushes — the underlying ``git push origin`` is a plain
        fast-forward push.  When the remote has commits the local clone
        has not seen, the push is rejected and the returned
        :class:`PushResult` carries ``reason="non_fast_forward"`` plus a
        hint pointing at ``git_sync(direction='pull')``.  The caller is
        expected to reconcile via the pull path and then retry.

        Acquires :attr:`_lock` for the duration so the periodic pull loop
        and the per-write commit + deferred-push pipeline cannot race
        against the synchronous push.  This blocks writes for the network
        round-trip; that is acceptable for the interactive ``git_sync``
        tool and mirrors :meth:`force_pull`.

        ``dry_run`` is a no-op.  Git has no safe local probe for "would
        this push be accepted by the remote": the only authoritative
        check is to actually attempt the push.  Rather than silently
        substitute a misleading approximation, we surface this with
        ``reason="dry_run_unsupported"`` so callers can document the
        limitation.

        Args:
            dry_run: When ``True``, returns immediately without contacting
                the remote.  See above for the rationale.

        Returns:
            :class:`PushResult` describing the operation.  See the
            ``reason`` field for the full enumeration of outcomes.
