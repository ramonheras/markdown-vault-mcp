"""Generic FastMCP server for markdown collections.

Exposes :class:`~markdown_vault_mcp.collection.Collection` methods as MCP tools
with proper ``ToolAnnotations``.  Uses a lifespan hook to build the
``Collection`` once at startup and tear it down on shutdown.

The server is configured entirely via environment variables (see
:mod:`markdown_vault_mcp.config`).  Call :func:`make_server` to build a
configured :class:`~fastmcp.FastMCP` instance.
