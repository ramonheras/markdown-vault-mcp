Step 1: Call `read` with path='$path'. Review the document.
Step 2: Identify specific improvements: factual corrections, clarity, structure, completeness.
Step 3: Present your proposed changes to the user before editing. Then apply each change using `edit`. `edit` requires an exact `old_text` substring from the document returned in Step 1 — do not paraphrase. Each `edit` call changes one location; use multiple calls for multiple changes.
Do not use `write` — it overwrites the entire file including frontmatter.
If `read` fails, report the error and stop.
