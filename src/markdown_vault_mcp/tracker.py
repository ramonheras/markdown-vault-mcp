class ChangeTracker:
    """Detects file additions, modifications, and deletions using SHA256 hashes.

    State is persisted as a JSON file with two maps of relative document path
    to last-seen SHA256 hex digest: ``indexed`` (files that made it into the
    index) and ``skipped`` (files seen on disk but deliberately not indexed,
    e.g. missing required frontmatter). A skipped file is only re-reported as
    added when its content changes, so it can be re-evaluated. Legacy state
    files (a flat path-to-hash object) load fine; all entries are treated as
    indexed. On the first run (no state file), every file on disk is treated
    as newly added.

    Example::

        tracker = ChangeTracker(Path("/data/vault/.markdown_vault_mcp/state.json"))
        changes = tracker.detect_changes(Path("/data/vault"))
        # process changes ...
